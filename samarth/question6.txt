Q. How to un stage changes from the staged area. write command for it.
-->

- When one adds a file in git repo, it goes through various stages,
- such that, first it's untracked, then it moves to staging area, and then local repo, 
 afterwards, if required to remote...

- Now, to unstage changes from the staged area, we would write a command like: 
   "git restore --staged <file_name.extension>"


My example : 

jspnlp@kislayJosh:~/Documents/Assignment2/assi2/samarth$ nano unstage_demo.txt
______________________________________________________________________________
jspnlp@kislayJosh:~/Documents/Assignment2/assi2/samarth$ git status
On branch samarth
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/samarth'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	unstage_demo.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
______________________________________________________________________________________________
jspnlp@kislayJosh:~/Documents/Assignment2/assi2/samarth$ git add unstage_demo.txt 
______________________________________________________________________________________________
jspnlp@kislayJosh:~/Documents/Assignment2/assi2/samarth$ git status
On branch samarth
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/samarth'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   unstage_demo.txt
______________________________________________________________________________________________
jspnlp@kislayJosh:~/Documents/Assignment2/assi2/samarth$ git restore --staged unstage_demo.txt
______________________________________________________________________________________________
jspnlp@kislayJosh:~/Documents/Assignment2/assi2/samarth$ git status

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	unstage_demo.txt
