Q. How to combine two commits into one commit? For Example, you have 4 different commits 
C1, C2, C3, and C4 and you to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit.

--->

One can combine 2 commits into one commit with a special command in git :
  'git rebase -i HEAD~n' 
whereas -i : interactive mode 
	 n : number of previous commits!

This will open up an interactive view for previous n commits before HEAD!


on this basis, one needs to decide what he has to combine, based on that, 
he can combine those commits in that interactive view.

You can choose what to pick and what to squash!

This is how it can look:
pick <hash_id_c1>
pick <hash_id_c2>
pick <hash_id_c3>

in our case it looked like : 
pick <hash_id_4>
pick <hash_id_3>
pick <hash_id_2>

For which we had to do just one change to combine 2 and 3 commits(c2 and c3)!:
pick <hash_id_4>
squash <hash_id_3>
pick <hash_id_2>
